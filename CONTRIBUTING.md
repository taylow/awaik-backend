# Contributing Guidelines

As the system/architecture is still in very early stages, I am still defining the guidelines that I would like contributors to follow. I am more than happy for suggestions to be made in the meantime via issues, discussions, or PRs!

Check back here in a few weeks (Soonâ„¢) and there should be more to go off!
